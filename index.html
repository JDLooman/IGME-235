            <h2><i>Bio</i></h2>        
            My name is Justin Looman and I grew u in Rochester, New York. In my down time I like to play soccer, volleyball and video games of course.
            A goal of mine would be to be able to make fun games for the next generation. I hope to get out of this class the ability to use another coding language and
            understand what goes into web development. I am currently a second year GDD student and have had a good time so far at RIT. When i graduate I would 
            like to land a job in the game field but am open to many other opportunities.
